# 27. LP certification

The [previous chapter](26-lp-architecture.md) followed a linear model from assembly
to a floating solve. This chapter covers the step that gives that solve any
authority: certification turns a numerical candidate into evidence about the exact
active linear model. Feasible points, objective bounds, infeasibility and
unboundedness require different packages; one cannot substitute for another.

The chapter first lists those packages, then the mechanisms that produce them:
safe objective bounds, exact reconstruction and refinement, Farkas and recession
checks, and strict inequalities. The later sections cover deductions for mixed
models, the model-facing optimization adapter, tolerance recovery and the
resource rules every mechanism shares.
[LpSolve](../klause/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/eignex/klause/lp/engine/LpSolve.kt)
owns these checks. A floating optimum, failed check or resource decline cannot
prune, exhaust search or prove an exact result.

## Proof packages

| Package | Establishes |
|---|---|
| Certified objective bound | A bound in the current model's objective units |
| Feasible witness | All active rows and bounds, with source reconstruction and required integrality |
| Attained optimum | A feasible witness and equal exact objective bound |
| Infeasibility | An exact conflict with supported source premises |
| Unboundedness | An exact feasible point and an improving recession direction |
| Indeterminate | No complete required package within the available policy/resources |

A bound does not imply feasibility or attainment, and a point does not imply
unboundedness. Ceiling an objective bound requires a proved integral objective
lattice. Combine packages only when authority, scope and objective units match;
exact rejection of one candidate is not a refutation of the model.

Certificates expose exact multiplier snapshots, so
[original-source capture](17-evidence.md) can consume them without adding model
dependencies to the engine. `LpCertificationPolicy` is the immutable acceptance
seam: certifiers always compute and report their observations, and the policy
decides which results may be used. A source check grants no permission to accept a
floating optimum.

## Safe objective bounds

The cheapest certificate is a bound from the floating duals alone. Slack-form rows
are equalities, so the Lagrangian

```text
L(y) = y^T b + sum(j) min over [l(j), u(j)] of d(j) z(j),   d = c - M^T y
```

bounds the minimized objective for every multiplier vector `y`; rounding the duals
only weakens it (Neumaier and Shcherbina, 2004). `safeObjectiveLowerBound`
evaluates it exactly and projects the result downward to a finite Double. A
negative reduced cost needs a finite upper side, and a missing lower side requires
a nonpositive reduced cost.

The integer variant rounds the duals to integer multipliers at a capped
power-of-two scale and accumulates in Int128; nonfinite duals or overflow decline.
An integral objective lattice lets the bound be ceiled. Node bounding takes the
tighter of the accepted safe and integer bounds. Variable bounds use the same
argument with a single-column objective.

## Certification mechanisms

When a safe bound is not enough, the dispatcher selects applicable mechanisms under
consumer budgets. They are not a mandatory order, and denominator, tolerance and
stall heuristics only schedule work; they never authorize proofs.

| Mechanism | Acceptance checks |
|---|---|
| Integer Lagrangian | Round dual multipliers at a power-of-two scale and aggregate in Int128. Can certify bounds, fixings or Farkas without a basis. |
| Rational reconstruction | Continued fractions and common denominators; check equations, bounds, signs and complementarity exactly. |
| Residual refinement | Solve scaled rational corrections through the same floating engine and basis; accumulate exactly and reconstruct. |
| Rational basis verification | Exact FTRAN gives basics; BTRAN gives duals or Farkas candidates. Singularity requests repair. |
| Exact continuation | Import the numerical basis pivot by pivot, repairing unseatable basics with logicals, then run Bland feasibility. |

Rational work escalates from `Frac128` to `BigFraction`; fixed-width overflow
restarts the operation from authority, and every attempt is charged. Owner-local
exact factors require the same matrix and ordered basis. An off-status feasible
point cannot furnish a claimed warm basis.

## Farkas and recession checks

For `M = [A | I]`, a Farkas contradiction requires

```text
rho^T b > sup { rho^T M x : l <= x <= u }
```

or the reversed equivalent. Free columns require zero aggregate coefficient and
one-sided columns a finite supported endpoint; equality is contradictory when a
selected contribution is strict. Bounds and scoped rows contribute their premises.

Unboundedness requires a feasible point and direction `r` with `M r = 0` and
`c^T r < 0` for minimization, with recession signs following each column's bounded
sides. Mixed-integer publication also requires an integer-feasible point and an
integrality-preserving ray, and finite optimization rechecks the pair in source
coordinates. Retained counter-proofs (witnesses against infeasibility candidates,
bounds against ray claims) are keyed to source, state and policy and invalidated on
relevant edits.

## Refinement and strict inequalities

For exact candidates `x,y`, refinement constructs

```text
M dx = s(p) * (b - M x)
s(p) * (l - x) <= dx <= s(p) * (u - x)
c(work) = s(d) * (c - M^T y)
x += dx / s(p)
y += dy / s(d)
```

then reconstructs exact values from the accumulated corrections. Temporary models
have separate authority, source state restores on every exit, and child owners
close. Feasibility auxiliaries shift the box to contain zero and maximize
`0 <= tau <= 1` with column `-b * tau`: a witness at one proves feasibility, and an
exact bound below one refutes it.

Floating solves the closure of strict rows, so a boundary point proves neither
strict feasibility nor refutation. The strict-margin auxiliary adds
`a(i) x + t <= b(i)` to strict rows and maximizes `0 <= t <= 1`: an exact witness
at positive `t` proves strict feasibility, an exact `t <= 0` refutes it, and other
outcomes decline. Zero-objective continuation instead keeps an infinitesimal beside
each strict seat, then picks a positive rational epsilon below every slack crossing
and verifies the point against the exact source. A strict infimum need not be
attained.

## Mixed deduction operations

Models with continuous columns cannot use the integer certificate's lattice
reasoning directly. `LpDeductionCertificate` generalizes it with exact
source-objective bounds, reduced costs, multiplier snapshots and movement limits
for integral coordinates; integer models keep `IntegerCertificate`.

`nodeDualCertificate` checks a dual vector against an `LpExactState`. Every nonzero
continuous reduced cost needs its finite minimizing endpoint; when one is missing,
bounded repair or alternative vectors are tried, each checked completely, and real
coordinates are never movement targets. `mixedRowBounds` projects active mixed rows
onto integral coordinates, citing the supporting side of every other term and
cancelling single continuous columns through paired rows or singleton equalities.

Certificate identity binds deductions to their exact state, so pop, bound changes
and objective edits prevent reuse. Node bounding prunes with the strongest
completed certificate; when none completes, an accepted safe objective bound still
supports pruning. These operations share one allowance: 128-bit scalar admission,
250,000 work units and 16 MiB of metered allocation.

## Model-facing linear optimization

Open linear models need the same guarantees in original-source terms. The
`lp.optimization` adapter accepts exact affine source premises, objective identity
and invocation restrictions, reconstructs nonnegative source row combinations for
bounds, and checks source witnesses and recession directions. A strict infimum is
reported as a limit: a checked strict bound, a closure endpoint and a feasible base
approached along `endpoint + t * (base - endpoint)`.

`OpenTheoryPipeline.optimizeLinear` runs a complete affine context in the shared
search session. A branch optimum becomes global only after every required Boolean
and integer alternative has a checked bound or refutation; an improving source ray
needs no siblings. When numerical authority declines, the exact descent of the
[linear theories](20-linear-real.md) continues in the same state and allowance.
`NumericalLinearRequest.solve` serves MPS through the same numerical authority, and
these adapters never confer source semantics on a rounded or tolerance model.

## Tolerance recovery

MPS finite-leaf tolerance recovery can justify a tolerance gap with exact basis
duals. `exactBasisDuals` refines the duals on one floating factorization, solving
for a correction from the exact residual `c(B) - B^T y` scaled by a power of two,
which stays dyadic when every basic column and cost is dyadic. Continued fractions
then recover the duals and `B^T y = c(B)` is checked exactly; non-dyadic authority
declines. Exact duals do not turn a floating primal into an exact witness.

## Resources and cancellation

Dimensions, fill, bit growth, deterministic work and memory gate exact work.
Dimension guards run before any allocation, and nothing is cached as eligible.
Exact mechanisms have no default internal clock cap but keep work and memory
limits and caller cancellation; root LP keeps a deadline backstop. Fallback,
retries and nested operations share one invocation allowance, and setup, failed
attempts and cleanup are charged. Cheap exact arithmetic charges operand
word-length squared.

Reconstruction and refinement poll ordinary tokens every 64 calls or 4096 work,
while resource caps are checked on every charge. Cancelled evidence is discarded.
A continuous leaf that stays undecided is skipped without learning a nogood, and
its incomplete flag prevents exhaustion or optimality publication. Numerical
failure, singularity, work stops, precision declines and cancellation keep distinct
diagnostics.

## Validation

Check original-source rows, bounds, integrality, objectives, rays and conflict
antecedents independently, including scope after pop/remap. A production checker
calling itself is not independent validation.
